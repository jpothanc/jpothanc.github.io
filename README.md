# Hey there, I'm Jessish! 👋

I'm passionate about web development and currently diving deeper into React to strengthen my skills and consolidate my knowledge in one place.

## About Me

I'm all about finding fresh, unique ways to approach things. Whether it's crafting sleek UIs, coding software, or building HTML pages and dynamic PowerPoint presentations, I'm drawn to the art of making things stand out.

While I'm not an artist who can draw, I've always had an eye for aesthetics. I remember creating a unique Flash portfolio back in 2001—it was an adventure. It was during my college days when I stumbled upon JavaScript, playing with light sources and being mesmerized by its potential.

I don't claim to be a design master, but I believe I have a good sense of it. I've been out of the portfolio game for a while, mainly due to a packed schedule. Instead, I'd craft quick UIs using C#, often tweaking them with dark themes to suit my style. That experience led me to create a simple skin NuGet package.

Finally, I found time in the last few months to dive into React—and it's been a game-changer! This inspired me to create a comprehensive portfolio, showcasing who I am and what I can do in the web tech world.

Join me as I continue exploring, learning, and leaving my mark in the digital realm.
